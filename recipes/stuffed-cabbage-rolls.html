    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Put the cabbage head in 
            the water and slowly boil for about 30-35 minutes. Take the cabbage out and
            cool it. With a sharp knife carefully cut of 12-16 leaves without breaking them.</li>
        <li>In a medium pot, sauté the finely chopped onions in lard or vegetable oil
            over low heat, stirring frequently, until translucent. Do not let them burn. 
            Salt lightly to help tenderize them. The onions should be cut into very, very
            small pieces. Add a small amount of water, if necessary, to prevent sticking
            to the pan.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat, add 3 tablespoons of sweet Hungarian paprika, 
            stir well. Go by the color, if it is pale, rather orange than red, add a bit 
            more paprika. Do not burn the paprika or it will become bitter.</li>
        <li>Combine the ground meat, egg, rice, garlic, half of the sautéed onions-paprika
            mixture, ground black pepper, and salt to taste. Form medium-sized balls.</li>
        <li>Flatten the cabbage leaves or remove the thick stalks from the center. 
            Place 1 ball on each leaf, and roll it up firmly, folding the edges under.</li>
        <li>Place 1 ball on each leaf, and roll it up firmly, folding the edges under.</li>
        <li>Rinse the sauerkraut under running water and mix it with the second half of
            the paprika-onion mixture, the ground caraway seeds, the bay leaf and the 
            flour. Spread half of it on the bottom of your pot. Place the cabbage rolls
            on top and cover them with the remaining sauerkraut.</li>
        <li>Pour water over. The water should not cover the sauerkraut, but when you press
            it with a wooden spoon, you should see the water.</li>
        <li>Cover with a lid and put it in the preheated oven (180°C/350F) and cook for
            about 1.5 - 2 hours, until the sauerkraut is tender. You can also test the
