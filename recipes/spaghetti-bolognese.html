    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mom's spaghetti Bolognese recipe was passed on from my Italian grandfather.
        The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely! To make this recipe
        more authentic, you can use a mixture of ground veal, pork, and beef.
        You can also substitute 1/2 cup of red wine for the balsamic vinegar.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 strips bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
            Stir in spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook spaghetti uncovered,
            stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite,
            about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; add bacon. Cook, turning
            occasionally, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Add onion, celery, carrot,
            and oregano to bacon; continue cooking until vegetables begin to soften,
            8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
            Crumble in ground beef; cook and stir until no longer pink and completely
            cooked, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour vinegar over ground beef mixture; simmer until liquid evaporates,
            about 5 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar;
            bring to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, then remove from heat.
            Stir in basil. </li>
        <li>Spoon sauce over spaghetti; top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</li>
    </ol>
